# SCTRR

Codes for our paper "Smooth Compact Tensor Ring Regression" in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.

# Requirements

The algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB and based on Tensor Toolbox 2.6 (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/).


# Contents

demo  --- a simulation test for the proposed SCTRR method

SCTRR --- the main function for the proposed SCTRR method

init_trmodel --- generate a random tensor rings with given size and rank

update-ul --- the solution for each subproblem with respect to U^(1), ..., U^(L)

updat_vm --- the solution for each subproblem with respect to U^(L+1), ..., U^(L+M)
